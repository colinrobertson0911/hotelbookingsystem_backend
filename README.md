The master is an old project we converted to use SpringMVC and REST we also added Spring Security and it is setup to use Angular for the front end.

The other branch is the same project but it is setup to use React for the front end.

These were group projects that we tackled when I was with FDM, it was to introduce us to different frameworks and get use to diving in to a project 
that was already completed and had to be converted and also to learn to become full stack developers.
